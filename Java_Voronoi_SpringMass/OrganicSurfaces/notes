TODO

deactivate cells to save CPU
reconstruct springs on drawing, spring rigidity varies, tests
grow spring sizes over time then kill?
** particles actually attraced to centre of mass of their own polygons?**
** for a given polygon, fill out with uniformly distributed particles ** with boundary.
add weights to points (weigted voronoi diagram?)
refactor points sets - make uniform
also possibly consider: springs break under tension
naming - masses v points?

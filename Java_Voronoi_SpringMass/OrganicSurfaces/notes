TODO

deactivate cells to save CPU
reconstruct springs on drawing, spring rigidity varies, tests
grow spring sizes over time then kill?
** particles actually attraced to centre of mass of their own polygons?**
** for a given polygon, fill out with uniformly distributed particles ** with boundary.
add weights to points (weigted voronoi diagram?)
refactor points sets - make uniform
also possibly consider: springs break under tension
naming - masses v points?

problems:
redistribution of cells is possibly broken - need to organise cell groups properly
some regions are stupidly big (could we just limit regions to overlap of voronoi cell and limiting circle?)
mass spring system probably needs to form more appropriate structures
 - convex bodies with centres, possibly connected, mass spring system could correlate to group system
mass spring system then needs to adaptively enforce boundaries: 
 - tighter line of cells at boundaries (surface tension)
 - repulsion between regions
new regions inside old regions, need to make work

Alternative idea:
spraypaint region based - paint onto grid, scan grids to discover regions
